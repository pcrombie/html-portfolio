<h1>HTML Boilerplate</h1>
<h2>HTML File Structure</h2>
<p>A boilerplate is what you start off with for any new HTML file.  There is a structure to the HTML files and it looks like the following:</br>
<p> "!DOCTYPE html" - it tells the browser that the html file was written in version 5</br>
    "html lang="en"  - this is the language of the text language.  This is important for screen readers</br>
    "head" "/head" - this is an area about important information of the website that doesn't include any content that the user will see</br>
      "meta charset="UTF-8" - this ensures that the characters on the website gets displayed correctly </br>
      "title My Website</title>" - this is the title that gets displayed in the tab bar</br>
        "body" "/body" - this is where are the content (h1, p) of the website goes </br>
        "/html"</br>
</p>
