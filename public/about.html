<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have over 17 years of experience in project and program management and I'm certified as an Advanced Scrum Master. </br>
My most recent role was at BrightMLS, where I served as a Sr. Project Manager / Scrum Master (PM/SM) for 8 years. </br>
In this PM/SM role, I provided leadership and guidance to two distributed feature teams: </br>

<h2>Agile/Scrum/SAFe</h2>
<p>I have over 10 years of extensive experience in Agile/Scrum, having been a Scrum Master for 5 of the 10 years.  </br>
In three years I have facilitated over 15 Program Increment events using SAFE and I'm confident in my ability to lead and support multiple </br>
distributed teams.  I have experience with different types of applications and the effective use of different types of tools. </br> 
For example, I've used collaboration tools such as Jira for issue management, Miro for facilitating the PI events and I've used other tools like Confluence and </br> 
Mural for the facilitation of retrospectives. </p>
